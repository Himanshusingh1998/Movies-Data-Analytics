# Movies-Data-Analytics

1️. Goal of the Project

The primary goal of the Movies Data Analytics project was to analyze a movie dataset to:

Understand factors influencing movie success (ratings, revenue, votes, etc.)

Identify trends and relationships among genres, directors, and actors.

Clean and prepare raw data for reliable analysis.

Generate actionable insights for decision-making in the entertainment domain.

2️. What the Code Does

The notebook performs a full data analytics workflow, including:

Data Loading & Inspection – Reading the movie dataset (Movie Assignment Data.csv) using pandas.

Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and converting data types.

Feature Engineering – Creating new metrics such as profit, ROI, and combining genres or votes.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Using visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn) to explore:

Top-rated directors and actors

Correlation between budget, revenue, and ratings

Most profitable genres and production houses

Statistical Insights – Computing averages, medians, and distributions to compare successful vs. less successful films.

3️. Output Generated

The outputs included:

Cleaned and structured movie dataset ready for analysis

Visual dashboards/plots, such as:

Top 10 profitable movies

Correlation heatmaps of numerical variables

Genre-wise performance charts

Actor/Director success comparisons

Summary tables showing profitability, vote counts, and average ratings

4️. Key Insights from the Output

From the analysis, the notebook revealed:

Movies with higher budgets tend to earn higher revenue but not always better ratings.

Drama and Action genres consistently perform well in both popularity and revenue.

A few directors (like Christopher Nolan or Steven Spielberg, depending on dataset) dominate the top-rated movie segment.

There’s a strong correlation between IMDB ratings and vote counts, showing audience engagement drives visibility.

Profitability is not always linked to ratings — smaller-budget films can achieve higher ROI.
